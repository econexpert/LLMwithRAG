# PDF Files RAG Chatbot

A Streamlit web app that enables **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** on PDF documents using:

- PDF text extraction
- Sentence embeddings with SentenceTransformers
- Large Language Model (LLM) for answer generation (HuggingFace transformers)
- Vector similarity search on MongoDB Atlas
- Chunking of long documents for efficient retrieval

---

## Features

- Upload one or more PDF files and index their contents by splitting into chunks and storing embeddings in MongoDB.
- Perform semantic search over PDF content using vector similarity search.
- Ask natural language questions and receive context-aware answers generated by a pretrained LLM.
- Delete all indexed PDFs and embeddings from the database.
- View already indexed PDF files in the app.
- Supports GPU acceleration (if available) for faster model inference.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/econexpert/LLMwithRAG.git
   cd LLMwithRAG
